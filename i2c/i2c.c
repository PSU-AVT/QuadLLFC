    @section DESCRIPTION

    Controls the I2C peripheral block.  For an example of how to use
    this i2c code, see the NXP sample software for the LPC1343 or the
    driver provided in this package for Microchip's I2C 24AA32AF
    EEPROM ("drivers/eeprom/mcp24aa").

    @warning  This code is based directly on the sample code provided by
              NXP and will be completely rewritten in an upcoming
              release of the LPC1343 Code Base.  There are a number of
              improvements that can be made to it in terms of organization
              and error handling, but since writing generic I2C code is a
              non-trivial task, we've included the current code to allow
              I2C access in the short term. Please keep in mind that this
              entire code block will likely be replaced in the near future.
